Notes
dlib can be challenging to install, especially on Windows. Ensure that you have a C++ build environment set up (like Visual Studio) if you're on Windows. For Linux, make sure cmake and development tools are installed.
If you face any issues with dlib, try installing it using:
bash
Copy code
pip install dlib --no-binary dlib
Let me know if you encounter any issues during installation!
